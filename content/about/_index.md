## Experience

I like building elegant solutions to complex problems. At this stage of my career, I adhere to the Elixir's simplicity and prefer building things with it. Let's chat!

### Projects

- [Torus](https://github.com/dimamik/torus) - a plug-and-play Elixir library that integrates PostgreSQL's search into Ecto, streamlining the construction of advanced search queries. Supports similarity, pattern matching, full-text, and semantic search.

- [torus.dimamik.com](https://torus.dimamik.com) - Torus library demo, where you can explore different search methods and their configurations.
- [Vault](https://github.com/dimamik/vault) - lightweight Elixir library for immutable data storage within a process subtree.
- [Legion](https://github.com/dimamik/legion) - Elixir-native framework for building AI agents.
- [Live Piano](https://piano.dimamik.com) - play your MIDI keyboard (or virtual piano) for your friends, live, directly in the browser. Uses WebRTC for low-latency streaming of MIDI events.
- [Live Chess](https://chess.dimamik.com) - play chess with your friends.
- [Advent of Code 2024](https://github.com/dimamik/advent_of_code_2024) - 25 programming languages, each day in a new programming language.
- [Subtitles player](https://github.com/dimamik/subtitles-player) - takes a video, generates subtitles, and plays the video alongside the generated subtitles.
- [Schedule your life](https://github.com/agh-kiwis/agh-kiwis) - uses time allocation algorithms to chunk and plan long-term activities throughout your calendar. Reallocates events if they are not completed on time.
- [stateofelixir.com](https://stateofelixir.com) - a PoC, similar to [State of JS](https://stateofjs.com) and [State of React Native](https://stateofreactnative.com), but for Elixir and built with Elixir - [GitHub repo](https://github.com/dimamik/state_of_elixir). The project is on hold since there were other surveys at the same time, and I answered most of the questions I had when doing a PoC and gathering questions.
- And a few others, not yet publicly shared.

### [Software Mansion](https://swmansion.com/):

- **[2022 - present]** Contracting for a large US-based company with an Elixir stack **(Elixir, PostgreSQL, Oban, Redis, React, GraphQL)** and legacy parts of Ruby:

  - Migrating legacy Ruby codebase to Elixir
  - Enforcing data consistency in a large production database with millions of active users
  - Translating real customer problems into working Elixir solutions

- **[2024 - present]** - created [Learn Elixir](https://github.com/dimamik/learn_elixir), a project to onboard new developers without prior Elixir experience to Elixir. **10+** onboarded people so far, each receiving extensive code reviews along the way

- **[2022]** - was part of a team behind [Membrane Framework](https://membrane.stream/), a multimedia framework in Elixir. As part of my work there, I delivered an introduction to Membrane talk:

### Freelancing

- **[2021 - 2022]** Recommendation systems, Python (numpy, flask, scikit-learn) - worked on a recommendation algorithm for a large literary portal. Based on books the user interacted with, we created a suggestions feed. [A Proof Of Concept that I used to recruit myself](https://github.com/dimamik/what-to-read).

- **[2018 - 2021]** Small projects empowering local businesses, Python (django, fastapi), Nest.js, jQuery, PostgreSQL

## Education

- **[2019 - 2022]** Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science at [AGH University of Science and Technology](https://www.agh.edu.pl/en/)
